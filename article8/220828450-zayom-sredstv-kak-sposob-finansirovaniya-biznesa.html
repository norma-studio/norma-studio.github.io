<p>Debt has a bad name. FromShakespeare’s quote “<i>Neither a borrower nor a lender be</i>” to Benjamin Franklin’s“<i>Rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt</i>,” wise heads through the ages havereminded us of the dangers of borrowing.</p><p>But for many smallbusinesses, borrowing is a powerful way to raise money to finance growth andexpansion. Just like any other funding method, it has its own particular prosand cons.</p><p>In this tutorial,we’ll look at the different options for borrowing money, and the advantages anddisadvantages of each one. Then we’ll look at some practical ways you cansecure funding on terms that make sense for your business.</p><p>This is part three of oureight-part series on <span>Funding a Business</span>. We’ve already given a rundown of the <span>mainfunding options</span>, and examined how to <span>fund a business from your own pocket</span>. After this, we’ll look at the various forms of equity investment.</p><p>But for today, we’refocusing on debt. By the end, you should be in a good position to decidewhether borrowing is a good option for your business, understand the differentalternatives available to you, and know how to apply for and secure funding onfavorable terms.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">1.</span> Different Options </h2><p>There are lots ofdifferent ways in which businesses borrow money. Here are some of the mainones:</p><h3>Bank Loans</h3><p>The simplest option isto go to your local bank and ask for a business loan. Well, it’s simple in concept,anyway: you borrow a specific amount for a fixed term of, say, five years, andpay it back in monthly installments with interest added.</p><p>If you can qualify,this is one of the best ways to borrow, because you get long-term access tofunds, at an interest rate that’s often better than those offered by otheroptions like business credit cards. But that “if” is important. It can be veryhard to be approved for these loans, and even if you are successful, the bankwill often ask for significant personal guarantees or collateral. </p><h3>Government-Backed Loans</h3><p>If you’re strugglingto qualify for bank loans, the U.S. Small Business Administration may be ableto help.</p><p>With these loans,you’re still borrowing from a bank or other private lender, not directly from thegovernment. But the SBA guarantees the loan, making it easier to convince aprivate lender to extend credit to you. There are programs for general smallbusiness loans, as well as for businesses facing special circumstances likerecovering from a natural disaster. You can find out more <span>here</span>.</p><p>The SBA programs canmake it easier for small businesses to qualify for a loan, but there are stilleligibility requirements, and getting funding can be a long process. You’lloften have to offer personal guarantees and collateral. And if you default, thegovernment backing doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. The bank will still try tocollect what it can, and then the government will try to recover the rest ofwhat you owe.</p><p>This program isspecifically for U.S. companies, but some other countries offer similar things.The Bank of England’s <span>Fundingfor Lending</span> scheme is one example.</p><h3>Business Credit Cards</h3><p>Businesses can usecredit cards, just like individuals. And the advice on how to use them is muchthe same, too. While they’re convenient ways of getting short-term access tofunds, and much easier to apply for than bank loans, it’s dangerous to let thebalance build up too high for too long. Interest rates are often in excess of20%, so it’s best to keep paying off the balance as much as you can afford to.Only use them for long-term funding as a last resort. </p><h3>Business Lines of Credit</h3><p>These work in asimilar way to credit cards. Rather than borrowing a fixed amount, you getaccess to whatever funds you need up to an agreed amount. But the interestrates are often more favorable, especially if your business has assets you canoffer as collateral. You only pay interest on the amount of money you access,not on the overall size of the credit line.</p><p>To see some examplesof how they work, you could check out the offerings from <span>Wells Fargo</span>or <span>Bankof America</span>.</p><h3>Factoring</h3><p>Let’s say you’ve sold$10,000 of goods, but haven’t received the money from the customer yet. Youcould go to a factoring company, which would provide you with $8,500immediately. Then when the customer pays a month later, the factoring companysends you the remaining $1,500, minus its fee.</p><p>Factoring is a goodshort-term funding solution when you’ve made sales and are waiting for the cashto come in, but you’ll need to look at other options if you want to fund yourbusiness for the long term.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">2.</span> Advantages of Funding a Businessby Borrowing</h2><p>All of these forms ofdebt have costs and risks associated with them. But if used right, borrowingcan have some powerful advantages for a business. Here are some of them:</p><h3>Full Control</h3><p>Many of the otheroptions we’ll look at in this series involve inviting people to invest in yourcompany, and giving up some control in the process. </p><p>With debt, on theother hand, you stay in control. A lender will want to see a business plan andwill grill you on your business practices and strategies, but once you’reapproved, they won’t try to take the reins from you as venture capital orprivate equity investors sometimes do. You may have to show financial reportsand adhere to “covenants” specifying things like the levels of cash you have tomaintain for the health of the business, but as long as your business ishealthy and you’re making the repayments, you keep full control.</p><h3>Retain 100% of Future Profits</h3><p>The main reason smallbusiness owners take out loans is to invest in the future of their company, andit’s logical to expect that investment to yield a profit. When you borrowmoney, all those profits belong to you (minus the loan repayments, of course).This is different from equity funding, where you give up a share of futureprofits to someone else in return for the cash upfront.</p><p>If you use the moneywell, debt can actually work out to be a cheaper form of funding than equity.For example, when Facebook was just a few months old, back in 2004, it secured$500,000 in funding from an angel investor, <span>PeterThiel</span>, who took 10% of the company in return. </p><p>The 10% stake thatFacebook’s founders gave up was eventually worth more than $1 billion. Ifthey’d taken out a $500,000 loan instead, they’d have paid back only the$500,000 plus interest: a much cheaper option.</p><p>Of course this is anextreme example, and in reality it probably wouldn’t have been possible forsuch a new company to secure such a large loan. But it does illustrate thepoint that although debt can appear costly at first, it can be worth it in thelong run.  </p><h3>Quick Access</h3><p>Whereas wooingpotential equity investors is a lengthy process, some of the borrowing optionsare much quicker. You’ll need to go through an application process and provideevidence of your business’s financial viability, but still you can generallyexpect a quicker decision, especially with things like factoring, credit cardsand lines of credit. Some online services cut the time down even more. <span>Kabbage</span>, for example, pledges to providefunds (if you’re approved) within seven minutes.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">3.</span> Disadvantages of Funding a Businessby Borrowing </h2><p>Debt also has itsdownsides, of course. Here are three of the big ones.</p><h3>Difficulty of Acquiring</h3><p>This is the biggestdisadvantage for many businesses, they’re simply unable to qualify for a loan.Banks and other lenders have become more cautious in the wake of the 2008 financialcrisis, and the requirements are often very strict. SBA backing helps, but eventhat program has eligibility restrictions.</p><p>The result is thatmore than half of all small businesses have been rejected for much-needed loansin the past four years, according to a <span>survey</span>by the National Small Business Association. In addition, 29% of smallbusinesses reported having their existing loans or lines of credit reduced.</p><h3>Cost of Repayment</h3><p>Every form of fundinghas its own costs, but with debt, those costs are more real and immediate. </p><p>With the various“equity” forms of funding that we’ll look at in future tutorials, for example,you give up a stake in your business and a portion of future profits. As we sawin the Facebook example, there is a cost to that, but it’s more intangible. </p><p>When you take out aloan, on the other hand, you commit to start repaying the money every month,with interest, whether your business is making any profits or not. The sameNSBA survey found that the average interest rate on a business credit card was15.6%, and many businesses were paying 20% or more. Other forms of debt usuallyhave lower rates, but you’re still locked into a repayment plan that will eatinto your profits.</p><h3>Personal Risks</h3><p>Often, banks will askbusiness owners to put up their houses or other personal assets as collateralfor business loans, or to give a personal guarantee. This is especially commonfor small businesses with limited trading histories. If you do that, the risksare substantial. If your business fails and you can’t pay back the loan, youcould lose not only your business but also your home. We’ll look more at thequestion of collateral and guarantees in the next section.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">4.</span> Tips for Successful Funding</h2><p>As those surveystatistics show, borrowing money is not easy, especially on terms that you canagree to. But it’s not impossible. Here are some strategies you can use.</p><h3>Cast a Wide Net</h3><p>Michael McKean ofhospitality company The Knowland Group <span>approached</span>a dozen different banks before he found an acceptable loan. Some rejected himoutright, while others came back with onerous terms. He kept going, andeventually secured a loan from M&amp;T Bank. His approach to M&amp;T wasexactly the same as to the other banks, but this time it worked. Persistence sometimespays off.</p><p>So don’t assume thatbecause you’ve been rejected by one or two banks, you’ll be rejected by all ofthem. Keep making proposals, targeting 10 or more different lenders, tomaximize your chances of success. And don’t forget to see if you’re eligiblefor any of the <span>SBA programs</span>.</p><h3>Go Small</h3><p>If you keep getting rejected for loans, tryasking for a smaller amount. It may be that the lenders don’t think yourcompany can handle the sum you originally asked for, but would be prepared tolend less.</p><p>It’s also worth going small in terms of theinstitutions you approach. Many of the large, national banks are wary of makingloans to smaller companies, because they still have to bear the administrationand underwriting costs, but make less profit than they would on larger loans.</p><p>So go beyond the household names, andapproach small local banks, community banks and credit unions as well. </p><h3>Be Careful What You Commit To</h3><p>With many types of loans, some kind ofcollateral or personal guarantee will be needed. If you’re desperate for thefunds, it can be tempting to sign anything you’re asked to sign, but it’s worthat least trying to negotiate, and even walking away if you’re not comfortablewith what’s in the fine print.</p><p>The first step is to offer as many businessassets for collateral as possible. The more security you can provide from yourbusiness, the less you’ll have to provide from your personal funds. So make afull inventory of anything you can include in your proposal, and try to givethe lender as much security as possible.</p><p>If it’s not possible to avoid making apersonal guarantee, at least try to put limits on it, protecting your familyhome if you can. Going into business is enough of a risk already, withoutliterally “betting the farm.”</p><p>It may seem as if you’re in no position tonegotiate, but don’t forget that lenders are not doing you any favors. It’s abusiness transaction, and they may be willing to make some concessions toconclude it successfully. If they won’t, it might be better to walk away thanto commit to terms that aren’t in your interests.</p><h3>Get Help</h3><p>You’ve already taken the first step byreading this tutorial, but if you’d like to go into more depth on any of theoptions, help is out there. The non-profit group <span>SCORE</span>runs workshops for small business owners both online and locally, as well asproviding mentoring and advice. The SBA also operates about 900 <span>Small BusinessDevelopment Centers</span> nationwide, providing help not only with SBA loans butalso other aspects of funding and running your business. And there are <span>Women’s Business Centers</span>aimed specifically at helping female entrepreneurs.</p><h2><span class="sectionnum">5.</span> Other Options</h2><p>So now you know some of the options forborrowing money for your business, and the advantages and disadvantages of eachapproach. Plus, you’ve got some strategies you can use to secure funding.</p><p>After reading this and exploring eachalternative, you may find yourself siding with Shakespeare and Franklin afterall, and deciding that debt is not for you. If that’s the case, don’t worry. For the next five weeks we’re going to explore arange of different options for <span>Funding a Business</span>, starting next week with atutorial on <span>crowdfunding</span>.</p><h2>Resources</h2><p>Graphic Credit: Bank designed by <span>Adrijan Karavdic</span> from the <span>Noun Project</span>.</p>
